# Code of Conduct #

The Italian SQL Server User Group (UGISS), a non-profit association, was founded with specific statutory objectives, including:

* sharing ideas and experiences through real-world case studies, discussion groups, and periodic meetings, both in public and private settings;
* fostering contact among professionals in the field and anyone else who is interested, in order to study solutions to problems or new projects;
* organizing and promoting conferences, conventions, round tables, fairs, meetups, trips, courses of study, and training activities within the purposes stated in the bylaws.

## In short ##

The tl;dr (*too long; didn't read*) version is that **professional** behavior and mutual respect are expected from anyone who participates in the association’s activities, both online (e.g., webinars) and in person (e.g., events or meetups).

## Acceptable behavior ##

The association’s activities are supported by volunteer professionals in the field, who expect equally **professional**, considerate, and respectful participation from all those interested in data management and analytics, so that experiences can be shared and everyone’s skills can grow.

With the participants’ consent, a more informal tone is possible, provided it remains within the bounds of mutual respect.

## Unacceptable behavior ##

Given that the reminder about **professionalism** should already be more than sufficient, and given that Italian law should cover virtually all unacceptable behaviors as they may be legally actionable, further clarifications should not be necessary.

However, at the risk of sounding paternalistic in an otherwise **professional** setting, we list some behaviors considered unacceptable: intimidation, violence, discrimination, and, in general, offensive or humiliating behavior related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.

In addition, the association is not the ideal place to address political topics of any kind or orientation.

## Consequences ##

In general, the organizers of the association’s activities cannot act in place of public officials; therefore, if needed, they will provide support in contacting the local judicial authorities (or on-site law enforcement, where present) and in filing any reports or complaints.

## Scope ##

We expect all members of the association, as well as any sponsors, speakers, and guests, to comply with this code of conduct in all settings, both online (e.g., webinars, online conferences) and in person (e.g., events, meetups).

## Contacts ##

To report an incident, contact the on-site organizers directly or send an email to info@ugiss.org
