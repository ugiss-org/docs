UGISS is a community made of people. If you want to contribute, here’s what we need and how to do it in the simplest possible way.

## Articles

We are looking for **strictly technical** content (SQL Server and the data platform in general). We avoid “work life” posts, motivational pieces, opinion articles, or non-technical current affairs.

Soon we will open the repository to allow public contributions via **Pull Request**.  
For now, please write to: **info@ugiss.org**

### How to submit an article (for now)

- **Format**: a Hugo *content bundle*
- **Minimum content**
  - title
  - abstract
  - author name
  - category (in the YAML front matter)

Example (YAML front matter):

~~~~yaml
---
title: "Article title"
date: 2026-02-16
categories: ["Articoli"]
tags: ["Sql-Server", "Performance"]
author: "First Last"
summary: "Short abstract (2–4 lines)."
---
~~~~

Common-sense rules (always valid):
- original content, or quotes/links with **clear attribution** to the author;
- **contextualized** contributions (no “dropped links” without at least one line of explanation).

### Tags

Use **only existing tags**. If you believe a new tag is needed, contact us first: we do not want to go back to having hundreds of low-value tags.

### Author page

To create or update an author page, we need:

- short bio
- extended bio
- photo
- social accounts (if desired)

## Events

If you want to help, write to: **info@ugiss.org**

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Logistical support** for in-person events (private venues, reception, on-site micro-logistics)
- **Organize an in-person event** (you must be ready to handle most of the local logistics, because we cannot manage it centrally)
- **Organize a meetup** (even a single online session)
- **Technical video** (publishing content on the user group’s YouTube/Vimeo channels)

## Code of conduct

In short: professionalism, respect, no politics.

## Historical perspective (legacy links)

This page has existed for many years and originally described the contribution workflow when UGISS was based on WordPress (Project Nami). With the website relaunch, the operational process has been updated and will continue to evolve (in particular, opening the GitHub + Pull Request workflow).
